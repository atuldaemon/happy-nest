                The apartment is very spacefull, very well equiped and
                close to the villa, where we could buy everything we
                needed at very good price.
                It is full of light and it makes you feel home.
                The owner is kind and took good care of us, we felt him
                (and his family) our friend.

                happy-nest is perfect. I like the big space and totally
                comfortable facility.
                Nice comfy bed, good kitchen  materials. But more than anything I like
                the owners. So kind and nice people.
                Atul is always there to help you with any case. The only minus is the
                distance from the institute but a very minor minus.

                It’s quiet and spacious, a bit outside the Iyengar Institute

                and easy to connect with.

            The apartment is very nice.  I like that you actually took
            the time to furnish as if someone lives there.  Many of
            those renting to students at the institute offer bare-bones
            apartments for top-price rent.  You seem to feel it
            necessary to offer something in return for the cost (which
                    is a good thing).  The small details, like the extra
            soaps, towels, etc., really make a difference.  And you're
            very aware of internet / cable problems which some older
            landlords can be shockingly unconcerned with.

            What I liked the most about happy-nest is the landlord. He was very accommodating. He cared. He did
            everything in his power to make sure we were comfortable and
            had what we needed. 
            The apt was clean and the neighbourhood safe and mostly
            quiet. The other tenants in the building were pleasant.

            There were lots of things about my stay that I thought were great:
1) Our hosts were super helpful, friendly, welcoming and really made the stay easy and comfortable. They went above and beyond to orient us, help us out, and provide extras to make us feel welcome.
2) The location of the apartment is great - a safe and friendly neighbourhood with all sorts of local shops nearby.
3) The facilities in the apartment itself are great - there is just about everything you could need, and was clean and tidy.

            I was in the apartment in February 2018. The apartment is extremely clean, light, spacious, comfortable in all aspects, there is a beautiful terrace where you can practice yoga. The kitchen is perfectly equipped. There is a fast internet that is very important thing for me. It is not noisy from outside, I slept like a child.
Our host is constantly trying to improve the apartment and is always ready to help his guests. Thank you, Atul! We will certainly come to happy-nest next time.

Ideal location, just at 2 min walking from auto station and vegetables-grocery markets, but the apartment is protected from the noises of the town ! And Atul and his family are super welcoming and took care of every detail during my stay. I really recommend this apartment for short or long stay!

                    I was in the apartment in February 2018. The apartment is extremely clean, light, spacious, comfortable in all aspects, there is a beautiful terrace where you can practice yoga. The kitchen is perfectly equipped. There is a fast internet that is very important thing for me. It is not noisy from outside, I slept like a child.
Our host is constantly trying to improve the apartment and is always ready to help his guests. Thank you, Atul! We will certainly come to happy-nest next time.

                    The location is good. It’s really “happy-nest”. Very calm and quiet area. The apartment is very cozy. One of the best apartment we’ve lived.
